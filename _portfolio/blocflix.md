## Explanation

BlocJams is a responsive website that can be played though the and device with access to the web. One is able to search through multiple ablums by different artist and albums to pick who and what you want to listen to. Once decided, one can pick the song in the given able and start listening to that song or skip to the previous or next song on that list if one chooses to. 

## Problem

The main problem when approaching the creation of this website is that getting the site to be work properly and getting each song to work properly and play the right song when called upon.

## Solution

To create this song playing website I took several approaches to complete the project. At first since it was the first projectI just used html, css, and DOM at first. Then after getting use to DOM I switched to JQuery to replace some of the DOM functions and after that I used Angular to replace the Jquery functions. his was done to get a use to these different types of programming programs and have a basic understanding of each of them.

## Results

The outcome of the website was a success after some basic struggling coming from learning a new coding technique, along with some trivial spelling and capitilization mistakes. I was able to make the site responsive to what type of media it is on, along with the ability to choose what you want to listen to. 

> I was able to add the function of switching between different songs and able to play and pause any song at any time. Another feature that I was able to implement is a seek tracker of the current song playing and move back and forth along the tracker to choose a part of the song you would want to listen to. There is also a part where you can change the volume of the song being played to be loud or soften the song to a mute.

## Conclusion

BlocJams took some time to learn and get use to the coding that was needed to create a functioning site that would accomplish what was requested to be implemented within the site and functioning properly. Learned how to use different ways to code certain things needed and what would feel best, easiest, and cleanest possible way.
