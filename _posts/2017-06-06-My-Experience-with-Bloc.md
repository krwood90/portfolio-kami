title: My Experience with Bloc
---

The experience that I have had with Bloc has been a good one so far given my lack of knowledge when starting to learn how to code. My knowledge or lack there of when it came to code left me uncertain about how well I would be able to pick it up and retain the information when starting, but I wanted to be able to challenge myself to see how well I could do, so I had decided to try and take the fast pace course and do fourty hours a week.

* Donec a diam lectus
* Sed sit amet ipsum mauris

To start of with my path I was given a choice of having one mentor to aid me in the path to being able to become a software developer. This, so far has been a great help in understanding and explaining tasks in which I have needed help in so far. As for the curriculum, the intro was a simple breeze and has laid a decent foundation in which to build upon although there were some parts that me confused and how they came up to that given final product, especially in the later checkpoints the guidance was very broad with where to go. This may turn out to be a good thing for challenging how you think later on, but for me at the moment since i am still just at the starting phase is a bit hard to understand what exactly they want you to do.

When it comes to the communication with Bloc for any problems that would occur, I have not had any experience with that. It is because I have not run into any problems that requires me to do so.
